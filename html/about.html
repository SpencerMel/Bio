                        <p>I started my journey in Allen, Texas where I grew up with my loving family. I have an older brother, two younger brothers, and a younger sister.
                            Now I live in Provo, Utah with my wonderful wife! We recently got married in late November of 2021 and are both students at BYU. 
                        </p>

                        <p>I currently work as a financial analyst for Freshly Picked, an eccommerce company that specializes in selling baby apparel and accessories. 
                            In my free time I love to spend my time outdoors backpacking, mountain biking, or skiing in the mountains of Utah. 
                            I also enjoy weightlifting, reading fictional novels, listening to podcasts, and playing the occasional game of pickleball.
                        </p>

                        <span class="p-header">Professional Bio:</span> 
                        <p>I am a student at Brigham Young University, aiming to graduate with a bachelor's degree in finance in April of 2023. 
                            I am focusing on learning and growing in all spaces of financial valuation, but I am most interested in financial markets and real estate valuation fields. 
                            Through my journey at BYU, I have grown to appreciate and enjoy solving complex problems and learning how to be creative in business strategy. 
                            My achievements in areas of interest include:
                        </p>

                            Analyzed, evaluated, and reported several case studies regarding portfolio optimization with stocks, ETF's, mutual funds, and other derivatives by using fundamental valuation techniques. 
                                These techniques and methods were focused on creating alpha by using risk-adjusted models to diversify portfolios.
                            

                        <p>-> Real Estate Valuation<br>
                            According to client preferences, applied discounted cash flow models to find the most optimal use of equity and debt in real estate transactions. 
                                Created sales and equity models detailing current market risk and values to increase accuracy for current and future investments further. in addition to evaluating local market risk and patterns
                            

                        <p>-> Customer Acquisition<br>
                            Analyzed a competitive landscape and created new clientele by negotiating with local door-to-door sales teams about the benefits of creating LLC and S-Corporation structures for their 1099 employees, which resulted in an acquisition of over 50 new clients in one month.</p>

                        <p>-> Sales<br>
                            Generated 100+ leads through B2B and B2C cold calling, networking, and referrals; scheduled and led tax presentations to potential customers resulting in sales income of $50,000+.</p>

                        <p>I have had work experience in real estate investment valuation, property tax valuation, business tax accounting, business acquisition, and sales and customer service.

                            Also below you will find one of my favorite woodworking videos. 
                            Woodworking is something that relaxes me although I am unable to do it in my current living space. 
                            Hopefully you enjoy the video and it relaxes you as well!
